To get actual verification

Making qr code:
Right now in my-tickets/page.tsx i do this:
Line 43: const qrMessage = "testing qrmessag";
- replace qrMessage with the message or what u want to give to organizer through the qr code to verify ticket
as a string

Checking qr code:
Right now in organizer/page2/page.tsx i do this:
- given the uploaded qr code i read its contents 
- then check if it matches what requied_message

line 14: const requied_message = "testing qrmessag";

- should change requied_message to equal what qr code has to say
- for now its all hardcoded
