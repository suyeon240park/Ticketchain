# 🎟️ Ticketchain
Traditional ticketing systems suffer from scalping, counterfeit tickets, and excessive fees. Ticketchain is a blockchain-powered NFT ticketing system that eliminates these issues by ensuring secure, transparent, and fair transactions.
Key Features:
1. No Scalping & Fraud – Smart contracts enforce resale price limits & verify ownership
2. Blockchain-Powered Security – Tickets are NFTs, ensuring authenticity & transparency
3. Seamless Entry – Instant validation via QR code scanning & local blockchain node
4. Lower Fees – Eliminates intermediaries, reducing costs for buyers & organizers

Powered by Solidity, Ethers.js, OpenZeppelin, Next.js, and MongoDB, Ticketchain offers a trustless, efficient, and decentralized ticketing solution for the future of events.
